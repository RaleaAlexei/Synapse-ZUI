# Synapse-Z UI (Rewritten for performance and stability)

Hey everyone, my name is Alex and I am obsessed with optimization, so I will maintain as much as I can this repo, some quality of life updates provide less ram usage (up to 386MB of RAM saved per 10 Tabs), less cpu usage and smoother experience.
I am doing this out of my free time, feel free to support me on my paypal.

A remake of Synapse X's 2022 UI in C# specifically made for the Syn-Z executor, completely open source for anyone to modify and create their own UIs with.
